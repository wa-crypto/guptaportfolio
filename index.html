        <p>Hi, I'm Susan and I travel around the world. I was born in Kansas, and like little Ellie, I always dreamed that a hurricane would take me somewhere to another country. And once I really ended up in another country - in China, studying at a business school. There I began to travel a lot around Asia in my free time and then moved to work in Munich. I discovered the world of low-cost airlines and began to fly somewhere and see the world every weekend. Being somewhere in the 15th country, I realized that I had enough experience and knowledge to share with others - and so this blog appeared. Here you will find useful tips, my travel experiences, life hacks and the usual daily thoughts about everything that surrounds me.</p>
